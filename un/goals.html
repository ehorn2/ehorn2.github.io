        <ul style="margin-bottom: 16px;margin-left: 120px;margin-right: 120px;">
            <li>To keep peace throughout the world<br></li>
            <li>To develop friendly relations among nations<br></li>
            <li>To help nations work together to improve the lives of poor people, to conquer hunger, disease and illiteracy, and to encourage respect for each otherâ€™s rights and freedoms<br></li>
            <li>To be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations to achieve these goals<br></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="text-start">International Peace</h4>
        <p class="text-start">Did the United Nations achieve its goal of international peace? The best proof of failure would be the countless wars the United Nations has not prevented. The United States became involved in wars at Korea, Vietnam, and actively in the Middle East. It has failed to achieve international peace, however it should be given some credit. It has stopped another world war from breaking out, and it could be given some credit for keeping the cold war from going hot.</p>
        <h4 class="text-start">Friendly Relations Among Nations</h4>
        <p class="text-start">The United Nations provides a forum for countries to develop relations far more easily than without. The International Court of Justice provides a place for countries to solve disputes in a much more friendly manner than through war.</p>
        <h4 class="text-start">Improve the Lives of Poor People</h4>
        <p class="text-start">Through the work of organizations run by the Secretariat, such as the World Health Organization, World Food Programme, and United Nations Children's Fund, the lives of those in poverty have improved.</p>
        <h4 class="text-start">A Center for Harmonizing the Actions of Nations</h4>
        <p class="text-start">Due to the process in which countries need to be admitted as member states to the United Nations, it is difficult for this goal to be fulfilled. Because of conflicts between countries, some countries are not recognized by the United Nations. For example, due to the conflicts between Israel and Palestine, Palestine is only an observer state to the General Assembly. Because of the conflicts between Mainland China and Taiwan, Taiwan is unable to be admitted as a member state to the United Nations. Conflicts such as these prevent the United Nations from being a center for harmonizing nations.</p>

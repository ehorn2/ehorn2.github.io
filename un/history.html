                <p><br>Following World War I, it was initially President Wilson's idea to keep international peace through an international group. He outlined the plan in his 14 points (see the fourteenth point on the right). It called for "mutual guaranteed political independence" -- essentially to keep international peace and prevent another world war, through a League of Nations.<br></p>
                <p><br>Many nations around the world quickly adopted and joined into the League of Nations. However, it faced resistance in the US Senate. As a result, the United States never entered the League of Nations, and the League fell short on its goals. Without United States support, it was unable to fulfill its goal of keeping international peace, and another world war would follow.<br><br><br></p>

                <p>Following the disaster of the League of Nations, a much stronger international peacekeeping group was needed, and the United States' participation was crucial. The United Nations Charter was signed by 51 countries on June 26, 1945, and went into effect on October 24, 1945. The United Nations Charter is the body's founding document, much like the United States Constitution. It outlines the United Nation's six main bodies.</p>

            <p class="text-start">It would be a few more years after the peak of antiwar music that the Vietnam war finally ended in 1975, and Nixon’s resignation in 1974. Nixon did, in his presidency, work to withdraw troops from the war, but he also intensified bombing in the region.  The songs began a more general genre of songs in defiance of the government, which persists to today, proving the lasting effect they have had on society today.</p>

            <p class="text-start">One performer was Jimi Hendrix, whose performance of “The Star Spangled Banner” sparked controversy. A rendition of the anthem, played on electric guitar, quoted taps as an honor to those killed by the war. He played blitzing technical passages, which “mimicked with frightening accuracy the screams of those who died in Vietnam”. It was a mangling of the anthem, almost a parody.. But, as journalist Paul Grimstad puts it, this is far from the case.</p>
            <p class="text-start px-5">“Jimi’s Woodstock anthem was both an expression of protest at the obscene violence of a wholly unnecessary war and an affirmation of aspects of the American experiment entirely worth fighting for.”</p>
            <p class="text-start">Hendrix’s anthem was both a protest and a paid homage to those lost in the war. The controversy and outrage it sparked might be comparable to kneeling during the anthem today, but at a higher level. Having Hendrix himself been a paratrooper, his message through his music was even stronger.</p>

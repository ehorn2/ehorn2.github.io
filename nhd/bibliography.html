            <pre style='line-height:2;'><i>Blowin' in the Wind</i>. By Bob Dylan, Columbia Records, 1963. This source provides an early example of </pre><pre>     antiwar music with strong lyrics. This is a primary source, as it is directly from the era </pre><pre>     being studied. </pre><pre style='line-height:2;'>Foner, Eric, and John A. Garraty. "Vietnam War." <i>The Reader's Companion to American History</i>, 1991. </pre><pre>     <i>SIRS Issues Researcher</i>, explore.proquest.com/sirsissuesresearcher/document/ </pre><pre>     2265467495?accountid=45026. This source provides some extra information about the Vietnam War. </pre><pre>     It helped with this project as it gave me some context to factors of the war that are less </pre><pre>     obvious through antiwar music. This is a secondary source, as it is a summary of the war from a </pre><pre>     textbook. </pre><pre style='line-height:2;'><i>Fortunate Son</i>. By John Fogerty, Fantasy Records, 1969. This primary source provides an example of </pre><pre>     how antiwar music questioned the ethics of the draft for the Vietnam War. </pre><pre style='line-height:2;'>Grimstad, Paul. "Rewinding Jimi Hendrix's National Anthem." <i>The New Yorker</i>, Cond&#233; Nast, Jan. 2021, </pre><pre>     www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/rewinding-jimi-hendrixs-national-anthem. Accessed 28 </pre><pre>     Jan. 2021. This source gave a lot of insight into how the public reacted to Hendrix's rendition </pre><pre>     of the Star Spangled Banner. It gave me a much better understanding of how his performance at </pre><pre>     Woodstock shaped counterculture and protest music. </pre><pre style='line-height:2;'><i>Imagine</i>. By John Lennon, Apple Records, 1971. This source helped me widen the array of examples of </pre><pre>     antiwar music. By including different artists across different genres, this song helped me </pre><pre>     strengthen my points by giving me a strong, but varied example. </pre><pre style='line-height:2;'><i>Jimi Hendrix at the Woodstock Music Festival</i>. 18 Aug. 1969. <i>University of Michigan Arts and Culture</i>, </pre><pre>     arts.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/35/2019/07/ </pre><pre>     Screen-Shot-2019-07-01-at-10.57.34-AM-720x540.png. This image of Jimi Hendrix performing at </pre><pre>     Woodstock perfectly captured both Woodstock and the performance of his anthem. </pre><pre style='line-height:2;'>Meacham, Jon, and Tim Mcgraw. "The Music of American Politics." <i>New York Times</i>, 2019 Jun 16. <i>SIRS </i></pre><pre>     <i>Issues Researcher</i>, explore.proquest.com/sirsissuesresearcher/document/ </pre><pre>     2294129635?accountid=45026. This article gave me an overall basic understanding of the </pre><pre>     different artists and songs that were popular during the time. It helped me get a basis as to </pre><pre>     what I should research further. </pre><pre style='line-height:2;'><i>Ragged Old Flag</i>. By Johnny Cash, Columbia Records, 1974. This source was nuanced, as it beams </pre><pre>     patriotism, while also criticizes the scandals of war. It provides yet another example of </pre><pre>     antiwar music's effects on the war. </pre><pre style='line-height:2;'>"The Sixties and Protest Music." <i>The Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History</i>, 2019, </pre><pre>     ap.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/sixties/essays/protest-music-1960s#_ftn2. Accessed 24 Jan. </pre><pre>     2021. This source provided a basic understanding of the entire antiwar movement, especially in </pre><pre>     the context of US History. </pre><pre style='line-height:2;'>Skolnick, Arnold. <i>Woodstock Festival</i>. 1969. <i>New England Public Media</i>, www.nepm.org/post/ </pre><pre>     meet-designer-who-created-iconic-1969-woodstock-festival-poster#stream/0. Accessed 7 Mar. 2021. </pre><pre>     This poster helps illustrate the Woodstock Festival and what it was all about, so it would be </pre><pre>     useful to include in my project. </pre><pre style='line-height:2;'><i>War</i>. By Edwin Starr, Gordy Records, 1970. This source provides one of the best examples of antiwar </pre><pre>     music during the era. Starr's strong lyrics and passion while singing are a perfect example of </pre><pre>     the genre, and support my thesis beautifully. </pre><pre style='line-height:2;'>Yanak, Ted, and Pam Cornelison. "Woodstock." <i>The Great American History Fact-Finder</i>, 1993. <i>SIRS </i></pre><pre>     <i>Issues Researcher</i>, explore.proquest.com/sirsissuesresearcher/document/ </pre><pre>     2265817656?accountid=45026. This source gave me information about the Woodstock Festival, which </pre><pre>     would be great for characterizing the counterculture movement in a context that supports the </pre><pre>     antiwar movement. </pre>

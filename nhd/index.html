            <p>The Vietnam War is known to have shaken the ideas of American superiority. As soon as the United States became involved, many questioned why the country entered the war. By its end in 1975, many more criticized it. Different music artists among different genres would soon speak up against the Vietnam war, a part of the larger counterculture movement. Anti-war music of the 60s and 70s boomed in popularity, defining an era of music, which is still replayed and celebrated today.

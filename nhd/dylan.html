            <p class="text-start">First, let’s examine the lyrics of some of the most influential songs from this era. The first is “Blowin’ in the Wind” by Bob Dylan. Written in 1963, it marked the beginning of a new genre of music opposing the war.</p>
            <p class="text-start px-5">“Yes, ’n’ how many ears must one man have<br>Before he can hear people cry?<br>Yes, ’n’ how many deaths will it take till he knows<br>That too many people have died?<br>The answer, my friend, is blowin’ in the wind<br>The answer is blowin’ in the wind”</p>
            <p class="text-start">Written even three years before the United States became fully involved, Dylan is referring to unnecessary deaths that would be caused by the U.S.’s involvement. The song’s title itself is a reference: The fates of the young lives that would be sacrificed are “Blowin’ in the Wind”; Undetermined, at and at a whim of a government. He also became known for his song, “Masters of War" In it, he criticizes the rampant militarism of the United States. Bob Dylan would become known for his songs which promoted peace, and as an important figure in the antiwar movement.</p>
